In the past several years, cloud computing has gained a lot of attention and lots of applications are now hosted in public cloud. Thus cloud performance becomes of interest to application designers, cloud providers and researchers.

In this paper, we examined two popular cloud offerings: Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. We measured their performance on different aspects: computation, persistent storage and network. We have identified several interest observations coming from our measurement results; and gave some suggestions on how to leverage cloud offerings in an effective way based on our observations.
